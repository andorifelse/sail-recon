## Overview

Sail-Recon is a feed-forward Transformer that scales neural scene regression to large-scale Structure-from-Motion by augmenting it with visual localization. From a few anchor views, it constructs a global latent scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. Conditioned on this representation, the network directly regresses camera poses, intrinsics, depth maps, and scene coordinate maps for thousands of images in minutes, enabling precise and robust reconstruction without iterative optimization.


## TODO
- [x] Inference Code Release
- [x] Gradio Demo
- [ ] Evaluation Script

## Quick Start

First, clone this repository to your local machine, and install the dependencies (torch, torchvision, numpy, Pillow, and huggingface_hub) following VGGT.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUST-SAIL/sail-recon.git
cd sail-recon
pip install -e .
```

You can download the demo image (e.g., [Barn](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ePgl6HF260NzQySklGdXZyQzA/view?resourcekey=0-luQ7Jaym5BQL6IjxsgXY9A) from [Tanks & Temples](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/)) and put the images in `examples/demo_image`.

Now, you can try the model demo:
```bash
# Images
python demo.py --img_dir path/to/your/images --out_dir outputs
# Video
python demo.py --vid_dir path/to/your/images --out_dir outputs
```

You can find the ply file and camera pose under `outputs`.

We also provide a Gradio demo for easier usage. You can run the demo by:
```bash
python demo_gradio.py
```
Please note that the Gradio demo is slower than `demo.py` due to the visualization part.


## Evaluation

Please refer to [this](eval/readme.md) for more details.
